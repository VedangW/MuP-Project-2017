# MuP-Project-2017
The ALP of the project to simulate a processor to control a fan.

The Question:
P23: Fan Speed Sensing And Control

Description: This system senses the speed at which the fan is rotating and adjusts the speed, based on the user input.

The user can select three different speeds of the fan.
The current speed should be sensed and the control mechanism should gradually increase the speed to the desired speed.

User Interface:
1. Fan starts when user presses ‘Start’ button.
2. User can then set the required speed by using a keypad interface. This speed value should be displayed on the display.
3. After setting speed initially, user should be able to change the fan speed setting by an up and down switch. Each press on this arrow button increases/ decreases the speed by 1 unit. Min speed value is 1, whereas maximum speed value is 5 Units. Pressing ‘UP’ button after reaching to value 5, should not change the display value or setting of fan speed. Same is true for lower bound.
4. Fan can be stopped by pressing ‘Stop’ button.
5. User can also set the mode of fan as ‘Auto’ mode besides a ‘Regular mode’ setting. In Auto mode, user should be able to enter the value of time in terms of hours after which the Fan has to be switched off automatically. (For example, if value entered is 2, then the Fan should switch off after 2 hours from the time this setting is applied.
